<p align="center">A Discord bot coded in TypeScript</p>

## üí≠ What is Vibe?

[Vibe](https://github.com/jebediah47/vibe-bot-ts) is a Discord bot coded in TypeScript that can do various stuff using it's commands!

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Fast Implementation

**Step 1**: Clone Vibe bot with git by running:

```
git clone https://github.com/jebediah47/vibe-bot-ts
```

**Step 2**: Edit the `config.json` file and change:

```json
{
  "TOKEN": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
  "PREFIX": "YOUR_BOT_PREFIX",
  "BOT_PRESENCE": "YOUR_BOT_PRESENCE",
  "MODLOGS_CHANNEL_NAME": "MODLOGS_CHANNEL_NAME"
}
```
üí° Quick tip: The `BOT_PRESENCE` option in `config.json` sets what Vibe's presence will be and the `MODLOGS_CHANNEL_NAME` sets the channel with moderation logs will be sent.

**Step 3**: Install all the required dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

**Step 4**: Run the bot by running:

```
npm run dev
```

## üéâ You're ready!

### Expected output:

```
We have logged in as [your_bot_name#discriminator]
```

If you got this output you are ready to go!
